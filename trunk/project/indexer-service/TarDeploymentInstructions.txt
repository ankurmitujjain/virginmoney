===============================

There are two runtime variables that are used in indexer-service.

queue.name			The name of the jms queue the service will listen on
solr.server.url		The url to connect to the solr server

The default values are shown below

queue.name=queue/indexerQueue
solr.server.url=http://localhost:8080/apache-solr-1.3.0

They can be over-ridden by editing file indexer-service.properties

Test
=====

Open ${svn}/indexer-service/test/stories/DON0020/CharityIsModifiedStory.groovy and change the hard-coded paths to fit your local environment.
Open ${svn}/indexer-service/test/stories/DON0020/FundraiserIsModifiedStory.groovy and change the hard-coded paths to fit your local environment.

Run target "test-easyb", examine the files in test/stories to see examples of usage and creating messages to add, index and delete 
charities and fundraisers. There are also some unit test classes in the test directory for more examples. 

The easyb tests are more of a complete end-to-end test using an embedded Solr server, while the unit tests use mock classes.

Deployment Instructions - 

1. Untar the tar file.

2. Application deployment components within /JBoss/Main - 

2.1 deploy-virgin - contains all the files to be placed in the deploy folder of jboss. 
2.1.1 Solr war file
When Solr starts it needs two variables:

solr.solr.home tell it where to find it's config files
solr.data.dir tells it where to write it's data indexes

They can both be provided as system.properties values, so either set JAVA_OPTS or 
pass them using -D when starting java

solr.solr.home should be set to ${jboss}/conf/solr
solr.data.dir should be set to a suitable location. Solr will need permission to write to the directory

Start JBoss and the Solr service should start. You can check by using a browser 
to hit http://localhost:8080/apache-solr-1.3.0/admin/

2.2 lib-virgin - external library files to be copied to jboss_server_home folder.
** Set classpath for lib-virgin on jboss.  

2.3 conf - contains JBoss configuration file. Please copy this file to jboss server conf folder. 
2.3.1 solr sub-directory contains configuration files for Solr. Review to check all values are appropriate

2.4 external-configuration - stores application configuration files. Copy this folder as-is on the file system**.

2.4.1 Create the system property GIVING_CONF_HOME to point to the location of this folder. 
           eg: -DGIVING_CONF_HOME=/user/home/VMG/external-configuration

** Please note that JBoss user should have access permission to this folder location.

3. Delete following jars from jboss -> production -> lib folder since they conflict with other jars used in the application. 
If not deleted the application server will give some error while deployiong the war file.
--asm.jar
--asm-attrs.jar
--cglib.jar
--jboss-jaxws.jar

Note:
Please increase the permgen size in run.conf as appropriate (256 m)
