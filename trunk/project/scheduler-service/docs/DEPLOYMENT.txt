Scheduler Service Installation
------------------------------

* Read the component overview document ($PROJECT_HOME/docs/README.txt) before you 
attempt to deploy this component as it provides essential information regarding customisation 
and dependency setup.

* Install scheduler service's data source by copying the $PROJECT_HOME/config/jboss/deploy/quartz-ds.xml 
into the JBoss deploy location (e.g. $JBOSS_HOME/server/production/deploy)

* Edit the installed quartz-ds.xml data source file to the point to the specific MySQL database
instance the deployment is using, not forgetting to set the username and password.

* Ensure the MySQL driver from trunk/root/thirdparty/libraries/mysql/ is in 
the lib-virgin directory of the JBoss server ($JBOSS_HOME/server/production/lib-virgin). 

* Ensure the Quartz JAR from trunk/root/thirdparty/libraries/quartz/quartz-1.6.1 is in 
the lib-virgin directory of the JBoss server ($JBOSS_HOME/server/production/lib-virgin). 

* Create the MySQL Quartz database, user (quartz) using mysqladmin tools and then the database 
tables by running the scripts in $PROJECT_HOME/database

* Rename or remove all and any instances of the JBoss provided quartz-all.jar from the JBoss server

* Rename or remove the JBoss provided $JBOSS_HOME/server/production/deploy/quartz-ra.rar from the 
JBoss server
		
* Check that the TWO Batch Job Service JMS queues have been set-up and are exposed to 
the scheduler service via JNDI (names defined in scheduler-service.properties). If not 
install them by copying the $PROJECT_HOME/config/jboss/deploy/jms-batch-job-destination-service.xml
into the JBoss deploy location (e.g. $JBOSS_HOME/server/production/deploy)

* Check that the Audit Service JMS queue has been set-up and is exposed to 
the scheduler service via JNDI (names defined in scheduler-service.properties). If not 
install it by copying the $PROJECT_HOME/config/jboss/deploy/jms-audit-service-destination-service.xml
into the JBoss deploy location (e.g. $JBOSS_HOME/server/production/deploy)

* Install the scheduler-service.war into the JBoss server by copying the
$PROJECT_HOME/deploy/scheduler-service.war into the JBoss deploy directory
$JBOSS_HOME/server/production/deploy/scheduler-service.war

* Install the external configuration files stored in $PROJECT_HOME/config/external_configuration 
into JBoss configured ${GIVING_HOME} location (passed to JBoss via the -DGIVING_HOME system
property)

* Edit the external configuration files to suite your needs.

* Start JBoss and monitor the server log file ($JBOSS_HOME/server/production/log/server.log), 
after a short delay the scheduler-service should be initialised and operational.
