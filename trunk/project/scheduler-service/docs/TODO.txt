Scheduler Service To-Do
-----------------------

* Determine real schedule information.

* Determine exclusion dates and times, if any, (to be implemented via Quartz Calendars),
we could use a Calendar to set exclusions that cover normal business operating hours 
thus making it impossible for scheduled jobs to be fired off during the day

* Send message to Audit Service from listener and create vm-commons.jar provided
GUID to tag messages for correlation with other systems (~1 hrs)
