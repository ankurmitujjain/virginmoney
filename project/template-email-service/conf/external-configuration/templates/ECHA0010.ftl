<p class="style1"><strong>Dear ${EDI0010},</strong></p>

<p class="style1">Thank you for signing up with Virgin Money Giving &#45; we look forward to helping you with your fundraising.</p>
<p>When you sign into your charity&rsquo;s account we&rsquo;ll  ask for your email address, date of birth and 2 characters from your password &ndash;  please remember these details and keep them secret.</p>
<p class="style4"><strong>What to do next</strong></p>
<p>So we can  start collecting money for your charity, we&rsquo;ll need a bit more information.  There are two parts to this</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>
Please print off the forms attached to this email, fill them in and post them back to  us:</p>
<ul class="content-list">
  <li><strong>CHN2 &ndash; Gift Aid</strong> <br />We&rsquo;ll need this to collect Gift Aid on behalf of your charity. This form asks for the details of 2 contacts at your charity &#45; if possible, please name a 
contact who has dealt with HMRC before.</li>
 <br />
</ul>
<ul class="content-list">
   <li><strong>Bank details form</strong><br />This is the details of the bank account you&rsquo;d like  donations to be paid into. If you&rsquo;d like to collect fundraising event fees  through Virgin Money Giving, you can print this form again and add a separate  &lsquo;trading account&rsquo; for the fees to be paid into. <br /><br />For every bank account you tell us about, please include a  bank statement. These statements need to be originals rather than photocopies  and dated within last 3 months.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">This is the address you&rsquo;ll need to send your  completed forms and bank statements to: ${EDI0040}</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br>
  Please  sign into your charity&rsquo;s Virgin Money Giving account. You&rsquo;ll see a checklist of  things we need including your charity&rsquo;s start-up fee, logo and description.  When every section of the checklist is complete, your charity&rsquo;s page will  appear on the website.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to do this now, please <a href="http://www.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/charity-web/charity/signInAction.action" class="style6">click here</a> to  sign into Virgin Money Giving.<br />
