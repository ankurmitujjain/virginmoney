<p class="style1">Dear ${EDI0070},</p>

<p>When we tried to collect your regular donation for ${EDI0100} we couldn&#39;t validate your card details and therefore were unable to take the donation.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve therefore had to cancel your regular donation.</p>

<p>To continue to make regular donations, you&#39;ll need to logon to our website and review the card details we hold.</p>
