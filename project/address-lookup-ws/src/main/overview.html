            This Service provides a way to search for addresses using postcode and optional property data.
        </p>
        <p>
            External service providers are called to perform the actual searches using a service proxy, as described in serviceproxy packages.
            The search requests allows the external provider to be chosen by the caller, if required. If no choice is made the service will
            make its own choice of provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Matching results are returned as a list of addresses in the form of a number of address lines, plus postcode, plus a 'single line'
            version which can be used to populate a 'picklist'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending upon the provider used, unformatted PAF address data may optionally be returned in addition to the main address results. This contains very
            detailed data from the Post Office's PAF files, and includes details such as walksort codes,building and sub-building names and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            See {@link com.virginmoney.addresslookup.business.PAFData} for the full list of available data.

        </p>
        <h3>Environment setup</h3>
        <p>
            This service requires a number of system properties to be defined in order to communicate with its
            back-end service providers, these are detailed below. Typically these are defined for JBoss in the
            'virgin.properties' file
        </p>
        <p>
            To communicate with Postcode Anywhere (the default address lookup provider) it needs the following system
            properties to be defined. Please note that these are the test account values, and that in the live
            environment each pair of properties will be different.
            <ul>
                <li>postcodeAnywhere.service.url=http://services.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/uk/simplelookup.asmx?wsdl</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            To communicate with IFDS (the address lookup  provider for SIPS products ONLY)
            it needs the following system properties to be defined. Please note that these are the test account values.
            <ul>
                <li>IFDS.WEBSERVICE_PORT_ADDRESS=http://qa-virgin-onlineservices.ifdsgroup.co.uk/OnlineServicesSoap/OnlineServicesSoapHttpuri</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The current VM infrastructure also requires proxy server properties to be present in order to communicate
            with external systems. These are
            <ul>
                <li>http.proxyHost=zoinks.eit.wrl.virginmoney.com</li>
                <li>http.proxyPort=8888</li>
